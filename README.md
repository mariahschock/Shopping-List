## The Golden Rule:

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

To Do List:

- Set up Supabase:
    - Make table
    - Add user_id foreign key relation
    - Add RLS for ALL actions
List Page:
    - Add <ul> element
    - Tdd render function
    - Add fetch function
    - displayListItems function 
    - add click event handler toggle to displayListItems function so when items are clicked, they can be crossed out to show they have been purchased
    - Add delete button and delete function with event listener

**Style throughout... DO NOT leave all styling for the end.
